# CS 144, Winter 2024 Project 2

## Running the autograders:

Before running the autograders, compile your code:

```bash
linux> make
```

Check the correctness and performance of your transpose functions:
```bash
linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 32
linux> ./test-trans -M 32 -N 64
linux> ./test-trans -M 64 -N 64
```

Check everything at once (this is the program that your instructor runs):
```bash
linux> ./driver.py
```

## Files:

You will modify this one file and only this one file:

| File      | Description             |
| --------- | ----------------------- |
| `trans.c` | Your transpose function |

Tools for evaluating your transpose function:

| File           | Description                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `Makefile`     | Builds the simulator and tools           |
| `README`       | This file                                |
| `driver.py*`   | The driver program, runs test-trans      |
| `cachelab.c`   | Required helper functions                |
| `cachelab.h`   | Required header file                     |
| `csim-ref*`    | The executable reference cache simulator |
| `test-trans.c` | Tests your transpose function            |
| `tracegen.c`   | Helper program used by test-trans        |
