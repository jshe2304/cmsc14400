1B)

- CPU loads instruction "idivl %ebx" at instruction pointer %eip=0x08031000
- CPU decodes instruction and identifies it as arithmetic operation to send to ALU
- ALU runs the instruction but detects divisor, %ebx, is zero
- A divide-by-zero exception is triggered. 
- The CPU looks up the handler in the exception table and finds it, setting instruction pointer %eip = 0xC0015200.
- CPU jumps to next instruction pointed to by %eip = 0xC0015200. 
- This is the first instruction of the handler, which is then executed.
